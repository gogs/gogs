# This is the official list of people who have contributed code to the Gitea/Gogs repository.
# This document should be reviewed and approved by maintainers.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# The agreement for individuals can be filled out on the web.
#

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the other addresses should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with github.

# Please keep the list sorted.
