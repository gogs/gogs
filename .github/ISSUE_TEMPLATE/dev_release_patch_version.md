## Before release

On the release branch:

- [ ] Make sure all commits are cherry-picked from the `main` branch by checking the patch milestone.
	- Run `task build` for every cherry-picked commit to make sure there is no compilation error.
- [ ] [Update CHANGELOG on the `main` branch](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/f1102a7a7c545ec221d2906f02fa19170d96f96d) to include entries for the current patch release.

## During release

On the release branch:

- [ ] [Update the hard-coded version](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/f0e3cd90f8d7695960eeef2e4e54b2e717302f6c) to the current release, e.g. `0.12.0` -> `0.12.1`.
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Actions to complete and no failed jobs.
- [ ] Publish new RC releases in [GitHub release](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases) (e.g. `v0.12.0-rc.1`, `v0.12.0-rc.2`) to ensure Docker workflow succeeds.
	- ⚠️ **Make sure the tag is created on the release branch**.
	- Pull down the Docker image and [run through application setup](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/docker/README.md) to make sure nothing blows up.
	- [ ] Download one of the release archives and run through application setup to make sure nothing blows up.
- [ ] Publish a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases) with entries from [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the current patch release and all previous releases with same minor version.
	- ⚠️ **Make sure the tag is created on the release branch**.
- [ ] Update all previous GitHub releases with same minor version with the warning:
	```
	**ℹ️ Heads up! There is a new patch release [0.12.1](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.12.1) available, we recommend directly installing or upgrading to that version.**
	```
- [ ] [Wait for a new image tag for the current release](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/actions/workflows/docker.yml?query=event%3Arelease) to be created automatically on both [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs/tags) and [GitHub Container registry](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pkgs/container/gogs).
	- Pull down the Docker image and [run through application setup](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/docker/README.md) to make sure nothing blows up.
- [ ] [Update Docker image tag](https://www.notion.so/jcunknwon/Cheatsheet-and-playbooks-c3b053da42114411bd27285cd065b2a6?source=copy_link#1654f105c63f80958d96cd72e2f5df69) for the minor release `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` on both [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs/tags) and [GitHub Container registry](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pkgs/container/gogs).
- [ ] Download all release archives and [generate SHA256 checksum](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/docs/dev/release/sha256.sh) for all binaries to the file `checksum_sha256.txt`.
- [ ] Upload all archives and `checksum_sha256.txt` to https://dl.gogs.io.
