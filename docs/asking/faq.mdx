Answers to common questions about Gogs configuration, administration, and usage.

## Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do I do if another service is already using port 3000?">
    You can change the listening port on the first run by passing the `-port` flag:

    ```bash
    ./gogs web -port 3001
    ```

    This flag also updates the port number shown on the install page, so pick the port you intend to keep using.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I run Gogs in offline mode or on an intranet?">
    Set the `OFFLINE_MODE` option to `true` in the `[server]` section of your `custom/conf/app.ini`:

    ```ini
    [server]
    OFFLINE_MODE = true
    ```

    This disables external network calls such as CDN resource loading and Gravatar avatar fetching.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make a custom robots.txt?">
    Create a file named `robots.txt` in the `custom` directory at the root of your Gogs installation:

    ```
    custom/robots.txt
    ```

    Gogs will serve this file automatically at `/robots.txt`.

## Administration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I become an administrator?">
    The first user to register (with `ID = 1`) is automatically granted administrator privileges. No email confirmation is required for this account, even if email confirmation is enabled.

    Once logged in, the administrator can promote other users by navigating to **Admin Panel** > **Users** and editing user accounts. A user who registers through the initial install page is also made an administrator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I reset a forgotten administrator password?">
    If you have shell access to the server, follow these steps:

    1. **Stop Gogs**, then create a temporary admin user from the command line:

       ```bash
       su git
       cd /home/git/gogs
       ./gogs admin create-user --name tmpuser --password tmppassword --admin --email tmp@example.com
       ```

    2. **Start Gogs** again, then log in as `tmpuser` in your browser. Navigate to **Admin Panel** > **Users**, click **Edit** next to the original administrator account, and set a new password.

    3. **Clean up** by logging out, logging back in as the original administrator with the new password, then deleting the `tmpuser` account from **Admin Panel** > **Users**.

    It is safest to stop Gogs before creating the temporary user via the command line, then start it again afterward.

## Repository management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I give Git hooks permission to users?">
    **Git hooks permission is a high-level privilege** that can allow arbitrary code execution on the server. Only grant it to users you fully trust.

    To enable or disable this permission, go to the **Admin Panel** > **Users**, select the user, and toggle the Git hooks permission in their account settings (`/admin/users/:userid`).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Other

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I create a wiki for my mirrored repository?">
    Mirrored repositories cannot have their own wiki because the mirror is a read-only copy of the upstream repository.

    If you see the "Welcome to Wiki!" page but no green "Create the first page" button, your repository was likely created as a mirror. You have two options:

    1. Edit the wiki on the upstream repository that is being mirrored.
    2. Convert the mirror to a regular repository under **Settings** > **Danger Zone** if you no longer need it to be a mirror.
