The Gogs API provides a RESTful interface for interacting with your Gogs instance programmatically. It aims to follow a format similar to the [GitHub REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

<Info>
  The API is bundled with every Gogs installation. No additional setup is required.
</Info>

<Warning>
  The API is still in its early stages. Content and endpoints are subject to change.
</Warning>

## Current version

All Gogs APIs are under **v1** using the request path prefix `/api/v1`.

```
https://gogs.example.com/api/v1
```

## Schema

All data is sent and received as **JSON** unless specified otherwise.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
```

All timestamps are returned in **RFC 3339** format:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00
```

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through the Gogs API. Requests that require authentication will return `404 Not Found` instead of `403 Forbidden` in some places. This is to prevent the accidental leakage of private resources to unauthorized users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic authentication">
    Basic authentication is used to obtain access tokens. Supply your username (you will be prompted for your password):

    ```bash
    curl -u "alice" https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/users/alice/tokens
    ```

    <Warning>
      Basic authentication should only be used to generate access tokens. Do not use it for regular API requests.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access token">
    Personal access tokens are the recommended way to authenticate. They can be sent via a request **header** or a **URL query parameter**.

    **Using a header:**

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: token {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}" https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/user/repos
    ```

    **Using a query parameter:**

    ```bash
    curl https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/user/repos?token={YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}
    ```

    <Tip>
      Using the `Authorization` header is preferred over the query parameter, as URLs may be logged by proxies and servers.
    </Tip>

## Pagination

API responses that return multiple items are paginated. You can specify further pages with the `?page` query parameter.

```bash
curl https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/repos/alice/hello/issues?page=1
```

Page numbering is **1-based**. Omitting the `?page` parameter returns the first page.

### Link header

Pagination info is included in the [Link header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) of each response. Use this to navigate between pages programmatically.

```http
Link: <https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/repos/alice/hello/issues?page=3>; rel="next",
  <https://gogs.example.com/api/v1/repos/alice/hello/issues?page=50>; rel="last"
```

The possible `rel` values are:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `next` | The link relation for the immediate next page of results. |
| `last` | The link relation for the last page of results. |
| `first` | The link relation for the first page of results. |
| `prev` | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. |

<Tip>
  Always use the Link header values to navigate between pages rather than constructing URLs manually.
