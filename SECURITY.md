## Vulnerability lifecycle

> [!important]

> Pre-existing vulnerability reported through https://huntr.dev/ or email (`security@gogs.io`) will continue to be worked through.

1. Report an advisory for the vulnerability.
    - Please be aware that **only advisories reported in plain English** will be reviewed.
1. Project maintainers review the advisory:
    - Ask clarifying questions
    - Make sure there was no prior advisory exists for the same vulnerability
    - Confirm or deny the vulnerability
1. Once the advisory is accepted, the reporter may submit a patch or wait for project maintainers to patch.
    - The latter is usually significantly slower.
1. Patch releases will be made for the supported versions.
1. After 14 days of the release, publish the corresponding advisory on [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories).
