# Security policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest minor version releases are supported (>= 0.13) for accepting vulnerability reports and patching fixes.

Existing vulnerability reports are being tracked in [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories).

## Vulnerability lifecycle

> [!important]
> Starting **Nov 9, 2023 00:00 UTC**, only security vulnerabilities reported through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/new) are accepted.
> Pre-existing vulnerability reported through https://huntr.dev/ or email (`security@gogs.io`) will continue to be worked through.

1. Report an advisory for the vulnerability
1. Project maintainers review the advisory and either:
    - Ask clarifying questions
    - Confirm or deny the vulnerability
1. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, the reporter may submit a patch or wait for project maintainers to patch.
    - The latter is usually significantly slower.
1. Patch releases will be made for the supported versions.
1. After 14 days of the release, publish the corresponding advisory on [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories).

Thank you!
