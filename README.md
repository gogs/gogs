## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across **ALL platforms** that Go supports, including Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and ARM.

## Overview

- Please see the [Documentation](https://gogs.io/docs/intro) for common usages and change log.
- See the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uxAoeLUl/gogs-go-git-service) to follow the develop team.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Get help with [Troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) or [User Forum](https://discuss.gogs.io/).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [guide](https://gogs.io/docs/features/i18n.html)!
