## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across **all platforms** that Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gitea.io/)!
