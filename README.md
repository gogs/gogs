## üîÆ Vision

The Gogs (`/g…ëgz/`) project aims to build a simple, stable and extensible self-hosted Git service that can be setup in the most painless way. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across **ALL platforms** that Go supports, including Linux, macOS, Windows and ARM.

## üì° Overview

- Please visit [our home page](https://gogs.io) for user documentation.
- Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes in each releases.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Help yourself with [troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) or ask questions on [user forum](https://discuss.gogs.io/).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [localization documentation](https://gogs.io/docs/features/i18n.html).
- Ready to get hands dirty? Read our guide to [set up your development environment](docs/dev/local_development.md).
- Hmm... What about APIs? We have experimental support with [documentation](https://github.com/gogs/docs-api).

## üíå Features

- User dashboard, user profile and activity timeline.
- Access repositories via SSH, HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- User, organization and repository management.
- Repository and organization webhooks, including Slack, Discord and Dingtalk.
- Repository Git hooks, deploy keys and Git LFS.
- Repository issues, pull requests, wiki, protected branches and collaboration.
- Migrate and mirror repositories with wiki from other code hosts.
- Web editor for quick editing repository files and wiki.
- Jupyter Notebook and PDF rendering.
- Authentication via SMTP, LDAP, reverse proxy, GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise with 2FA.
- Customize HTML templates, static files and many others.
- Rich database backend, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3 and [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb).
- Have localization over [30 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs).

## üíæ Hardware requirements

- A Raspberry Pi or $5 Digital Ocean Droplet is more than enough to get you started. Some even use 64MB RAM Docker [CaaS](https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/).
- 2 CPU cores and 512MB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Increase CPU cores when your team size gets significantly larger, memory footprint remains low.

## üíª Browser support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The smallest resolution officially supported is **1024*768**, however the UI may still look right in smaller resolutions, but no promises or fixes.
